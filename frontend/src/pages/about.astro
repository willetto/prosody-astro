          Reinventing email for this century
        </Text>
        <Text tag="p" variant="textBase" class="mt-4 text-base-500">
          The web's evolved — we've got AI art, self-driving cars… and email
          that still thinks it's 2005. We're over it. No more table hell. No
          more mystery bounces. Just modern email, built like it belongs in
          2025.
        </Text>
        <Text tag="p" variant="textBase" class="mt-8 text-base-500">
          Brightlight started as a side project in 2022 after one too many
          rage-quits over broken email templates. We were tired of wrangling
          tables, inline styles, and mystery bugs that only appeared in Outlook
          2010.
          <br />
          <br />
          But that was just the beginning.
          <br />
          <br />
          The deeper we dug, the more we realized: the real nightmare wasn’t the
          design — it was deliverability. Emails disappearing into spam folders like
          they were never born? Not on our watch.
          <br />
          <br />
          So in 2023, we launched Brightlight — a fully modern email delivery platform.
          No duct tape. No black magic. Just clean APIs, fast delivery, and emails
          that actually show up.
          <br />
          <br />
          We're building Brightlight to make email feel less like a relic, and more
          like the powerful tool it was always meant to be. Join us — it's about
          to get good.
