    question: "How do you make sure emails actually land?",
    answer:
      "We don’t believe in sending emails into the void. With clean IPs, smart routing, and obsessive deliverability practices, your emails show up where they’re supposed to — not in spam purgatory.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I forget my login credentials?",
    answer:
      "No worries — we’ve got a password reset flow that won’t make you cry. Just click the link, prove you’re not a robot, and we’ll get you back in faster than you can say ‘forgot again?’",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I schedule emails to go out later?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Queue them up for next week, next month, or when Mercury’s in retrograde. We’ll send them when you say so — no manual midnight sends required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support multiple environments (like dev, staging, prod)?",
    answer:
      "Yep. You can keep your test sends from leaking into the wild, and your production emails from hitting staging by mistake. No more ‘Oops, wrong list’ moments.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will you sell my data to shady ad networks?",
    answer:
      "Nope. We don’t do that. Your data is yours. We’re not in the business of selling email lists, creepy targeting, or tracking your mom’s click habits.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Brightlight on multiple projects or apps?",
    answer:
      "You bet. Use it for your side project, your startup, your startup’s side project — we’re built to scale, no matter how many hats you wear.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit to how many emails I can send?",
    answer:
      "Only if you're on a free plan. Otherwise, we scale with you — up to millions of emails a month. And if you break the system, we’ll be impressed… and then we’ll help you send more.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export my data if I decide to leave?",
    answer:
      "Yes — and we won’t guilt-trip you about it. Export everything with a click. Your data’s not trapped in a walled garden. We’ll even wave as you go.",
  },
